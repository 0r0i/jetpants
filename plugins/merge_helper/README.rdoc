= Jetpants Merge Helper

\The merge helper is a plugin for Jetpants to combine shards

\It is currently implemented using a MariaDB database as an aggregator node, though any installation that supports multiple replication streams would be feasible

\Command-line functionality is provided to execute a four-step merge process, with similar semantics to shard splits.  Additionally, there are several validation features.  These will both validate the merged data set as well as validate data existing in current shards.  Types of validation include programmatic shard key range validation as well as checks for duplicate globally-unique keys making use of a bloom filter.
